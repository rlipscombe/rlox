# rlox

Rust implementation of Lox from ["Crafting Interpreters"](http://craftinginterpreters.com).

## Progress

It's complete (as far as I can tell) up to the end of Chapter 10.

**Next:** Chapter 11: ["Resolving and Binding"](http://craftinginterpreters.com/resolving-and-binding.html).

## Differences from the reference implementation

* Added a modulo (%) operator.
* Anonymous functions.
